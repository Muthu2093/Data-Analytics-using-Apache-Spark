President Trump has been criticizing Amazon over the past week, and on Thursday he suggested — inaccurately — that the company is ripping off the United States Postal Service.
Jimmy Kimmel was dumbfounded by the criticism, and Jimmy Fallon took the opportunity to poke fun at Trump.
Dwayne Johnson sat down with Kimmel on Tuesday, 48 hours after April Fools’ Day, but he still found a way to play a prank on the host. He told Kimmel with seeming sincerity that his girlfriend had played an April Fools’ joke on him, pretending to go into labor and nearly letting him take her to the hospital before she revealed the joke. (All of that turned out to be completely made up.)
A perfectly reasonable — that is, nonsensical — debate on “Late Night” turned into a set-destroying stunt sequence. All parties seemed pleased.
Trump’s team wants to take its legal battle with Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic-film actress known as Stormy Daniels, into private arbitration. Kimmel thinks “private arbitration” sounds like the name of a porn film.
Mike Myers appears in “Terminal,” a new comic thriller. His part isn’t big, but it’s his first live-action film role since 2009. He will talk to Fallon on Wednesday night.
Cardi B, the rapper, whose interview with Fallon in January became a viral smash, will co-host “The Tonight Show” with him on Monday. It’ll be the first time the show has officially had a co-host.
